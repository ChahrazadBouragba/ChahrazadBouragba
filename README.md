# Hi there, I'm Chahrazad Bouragba!






Welcome to my personal GitHub repository. Here you'll find a collection of projects and exercises I've worked on as part of my software engineering journey.

## About Me

I am a junior developer with a passion for coding, art, and literature. In my free time, I love to create beautiful collections of art and read classic novels. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I am excited about the possibilities that the world of software engineering offers.
